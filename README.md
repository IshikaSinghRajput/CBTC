<h1>Web Apps Collection</h1>
<p>This repository contains two web applications: a Portfolio Web App and a To-Do Web App.</p>
<br>
<h3>Portfolio Web App</h3>
<p>The Portfolio Web App showcases my professional work and projects. It includes a downloadable version of my resume 
and a contact form which allows visitors to contact me directly. I used HTML and CSS to design the frontend of the project.</p>
<br>
<h3>To-Do Web App</h3>
<p>A simple and intuitive to-do web application that helps users manage their tasks efficiently.
Features include adding, editing, and deleting tasks, with an easy-to-use interface for organizing daily activities.
I applied HTML, CSS and Javascript to implement the functionalities in this mini project.</p>
